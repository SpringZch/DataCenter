This folder contains a simple command line utility to generate NED files
for FatTree networks. While originally intended to be more general, it 
can currently only generate fully provisioned (i.e. full bisection 
bandwidth) FatTrees with uniformly sized links and switches.
As a result, the only arguments are the number of ports per switch
and the number of levels.

Note this utility depends on several files form the src/model tree
and expects this path to be one level up.
